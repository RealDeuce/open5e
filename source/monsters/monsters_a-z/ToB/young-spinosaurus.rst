Dinosaur, Spinosaurus (Young)
-----------------------------

*A spinosaurus is a land and riverine predator capable of carrying
a platoon of lizardfolk long distances on raids. Often called a river
king or river dragon, they are worshipped by bullywugs and other
primitive humanoids.*

**Friend to Lizardfolk.** The spinosaurus is a special saurian
bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like
prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care.

**Enormous Size and Color.** This immense saurian has a long
tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running
the length of its spine. An adult dire spinosaurus is 70 feet long
and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, and a young spinosaurus is
20 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or more.

**Swift Predator.** A spinosaurus is quick on both land and
water.

**Tamed.** The spinosaurus never willingly attacks any reptilian
humanoid, and if forced or magically compelled to do so
it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls. Up to three Medium
or one Large creatures can ride the spinosaurus. This trait
disappears if the spinosaurus spends a month away from any
reptilian humanoid.
