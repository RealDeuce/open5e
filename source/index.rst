Open5e
======

Open5e aims to be the best open-source resource for 5e content.

.. Sidebar:: Hey! Stuff is missing!
   :class: missing
       
   Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the `5e SRD <http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf>`_,
   so we aren't allowed to include it in this site.

   We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party OGL content.
   `Contact us <mailto:gm@5esrd.com>`_ or `make a pull request <https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e>`_ if you know something we should add!

What are we about?
------------------

In addition to an open, readable, and easily searchable resource for the 5e SRD we have lots of new things we'd like to add! At the top of our list are:

.. rst-class:: list-bulleted

* **Machine-readable data** like monsters and spell lists, in formats like **csv, json, md, and xml**
* **Useful tools** such as **random tables, encounter calculators, treasure generators, And more...**
* Plus the best **OGL community-created** content on the web!
